# Just For Fun


I'm someone that has lot of ideas.

Every time an idea comes to my mind, I try to bring it to life even if I will not cross the line or finish it.

I was wondering that I used to create separate repositories each time, but now, I've chosen to use a monorepo instead.

So, when any idea will come, I will create a new folder for that or improve existing one, **Just For Fun**.

*I am unlimited, I can do whatever I want.*
